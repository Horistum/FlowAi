# Flow Adapter Portfolio Changelog

## Unreleased

### A0.1 Adapter Portfolio Reassessment

Started the adapter roadmap after Core `0.9.7.10` and bounded correction `0.9.7.10.2` were merged and validated.

Completed scope:

- transition the primary roadmap stream from completed Core work to adapters;
- generalize Flow Agent roadmap selection and tests for a non-Core primary stream;
- introduce a strict distribution-owned adapter portfolio manifest;
- require exactly one support, limitation and evidence record for every target registry identity;
- distinguish semantic reference, profile-only, native-leaf-only and executable-reference claims;
- reconcile portfolio claims with actual provider composition and native projection rules;
- preserve Jenkins as the only current committed end-to-end executable reference target;
- classify GitHub Actions and Tekton as native-leaf-only;
- classify Argo Workflows and Azure DevOps as profile-only;
- retain `local` as a semantic reference rather than promoting it into a production adapter;
- add committed executable snapshot validation for executable-reference claims;
- add `AdapterRoadmapLifecycleAuthority` to reject mixed, premature or evidence-free A0.1 completion metadata;
- add a separate adapter conformance inventory that runs after frozen Core closure;
- prove semantic Core packages do not depend on adapter portfolio authority;
- preserve package `0.9.5`, public standard `0.8.0` and artifact contract `2.0`.

Validation history:

- Flow CI #2256 rejected the first roadmap transition because A0.1 used unsupported item status `active`; the primary-stream tooling and metadata were corrected to the existing `next` lifecycle rather than weakening validation.
- Flow CI #2263 passed the portfolio implementation before lifecycle certification was added and is retained only as historical evidence.
- Flow CI #2270, run `30342473373`, passed the complete implementation on exact head `20191d2d7b9460894c81f9bfee73b3c11b8f78f4` and synthetic merge candidate `d3238468ba01fe8b97bc6f500c9f96f2beeb4760`, including Flow Agent tooling, complete tests, Core closure and adapter conformance.
- The completion-metadata head marks A0.1 `completed`, selects A0.2 as `next` and records #2270 structurally. It must independently pass exact-head and synthetic merge-candidate validation before PR #96 is ready for review.
